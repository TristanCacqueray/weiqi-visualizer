(;CA[UTF-8]SZ[19]EV[The Game of the Century]DT[1933-10-16]PB[Go Seigen]BR[5p]PW[Honinbo Shusai]WR[9p]PC[Tokyo, Japan]RE[W+2]KM[0]C[This match was sponsored by Yomiuri Newspaper. In the preliminary game, Go Seigen defeated the strong opponents Kitani Minoru 6p and Hashimoto Utaro 5p, thus earned the right to play this memorable game with Honinbo Shusai Meijin who hadn't played any game for almost ten years. This game started in Oct. 1933 and didn't finish until Feb. of next year, during the process the game was adjourned for more than 10 times, and it created a furore in this Newspaper and at that time it was also regarded as the game of the century. In the recent Go world, we never saw a game which had produced such a great impact.];B[qc]C[At that time, Go Seigen was just 20 years' old, in this match with Shusai Meijin, he started with the unprecedented opening of 3-3, star and tengen, which shocked the Go world. This special play was once criticized by some people: this is not polite to Meijin. As for today, this kind of criticism is just worth laughing. However, Mr. Go always holds firmly to his play, because Mr. Go just wanted to break away from all Shusaku's openings of 1, 3 and 5 and establish his own style, which is the "New Fuseki" he invented together with Kitani Minoru, so this game had another special meaning, it was a historical game between the new and old opening. In the game, Mr. Go had often made Meijin to cudgel his brain, and due to health cause, the game was adjourned for so many times (there was no sealing of moves, it meant that Shusai Meijin could adjourn the game at his will and continue to study the position leisurely at home with the whole Honinbo clique). In the end, although Mr. Go Seigen lost by two points, but it indeed let the Go world to acknowledge the "New Fuseki" and this meaningful match.];W[cd];B[dp];W[pq];B[jj]C[In this opening, Black takes two corners with B1 and B3, then occupies the tengen with B5. In other words, Black first takes the territory at 3-3, then obtains outside influence at the star point and plays at the tengen to take the center influence, aiming to achieve the balance of the game. But as for now, when you play one move at the tengen in the opening, you inevitably will lose territory; If you want to be more effective in fights by obtaining influence, it may not be a bad move, but it would be hard to manage later on, with regard to its result, it is difficult to recommend this opening.];W[pd]C[W6 is the most powerful tactic when your opponent has a stone at 3-3.];B[qd];W[pe];B[ob]C[B7 and B9 form a very common shape.];W[qn];B[jp]LB[nq:a][lq:b][jq:c]C[B11: Black develops from the star point, in the past playing at 'c' was common understanding. However as far as the "New Fuseki" is concerned, B11 is also a strong tactic. This is an influence-oriented play, certainly it is also related to the stone at the tengen, however if there is no tengen stone, next Black still can check at 'a' at the maximum limit to form a good shape. Therefore, White has no choice but to block at 'b', leaving White no opportunity to approach the corner in the upper left.];W[lq]LB[nq:a][ed:b][dj:c]C[W12: White certainly aims to prevent Black from checking at 'a'; But what must be noticed is that, if White immediately protects the corner at 'b', then Black is left with an excellent point at 'c', this is more obvious big point than 'a'.];B[dj]LB[ed:a]C[However, B13 seems not ideal. Suppose we change the sequence, as for W12, White first plays at 'a', Black plays at 13, then White blocks at 12, it is OK as far as Go theories are concerned, but B13 itself still appears a little dissatisfactory.];W[ed];B[lo]AE[nq]LB[nq:a]C[The purpose of B15 is correlated to the tengen stone, building center influence. If White tenukis, next Black would invade at 'a'.];W[nq]LB[fq:a]C[W16: Thus, White plays at 16, guarding against Black's invasion, Although it is a solid move, but as for White, it seems a little grievous. White can consider to approach at 'a'.];B[kq];W[lp];B[ko]C[Because White answers at 16, Black unexpectedly has built thickness with B17 and B19. In other words, White decides to obtain thickness here with W16 and W18 then invade (with the following moves W22 and W24), however it would be better for White to invade while Black is still thin.];W[ch]C[W20 is now the biggest point on the board.];B[gj]C[The play of B21 is a shape that was used in the earlier stage of the "New Fuseki", but as for today, it is over influence-oriented. Because B21 is slow, Black falls behind in the opening, which can not be denied.];W[fq]LB[iq:a][cq:b]C[Finally White invades severely at 22, if next White grabs the vital point at 'a', White would be easy to fix his shape within Black's influence and destroy Black's only territory as well, then the following job for White should be easy. If White hesitates to play at W22, then Black will definitely make the diagonal's extension at 'b', if Black gets to protect the corner, it would be hard for White to invade.];B[fo]LB[eq:a]C[B23: If Black attaches with the diagonal extension at 'a', it wouldn't make any trouble for White for fix his shape.];W[iq];B[gp];W[cq]LB[kr:a]C[W26 is a light and nimble play, not making W24 heavy. That is to say, if only White is left with the chance to bridge over at 'a', no matter what happens later, White will be always easy to play.];B[cp]LB[dq:a]C[B27: Even if Black seperates White at 'a', White can extend at 27 to enclose territory and also leave the option of crossing over, Black would not be favorable.];W[dq]C[As for the result up to W28, White has invaded Black's only territory. White probably will make a territory of about ten points, White has achieved a big victory. Overall, White cleverly takes advantage of the slow move of B21.];B[nd]C[B29 is the only key point at this juncture, chasing and attacking the two white stones and also developing towards the upper left.];W[ph]C[If White fails to play at W30, Black will definitely takes this key spot to attack the two white stones. If the two white stones come under attack, even though White can take other good points but it would be not enough to redeem his losses in this area.];B[pj]AE[gc]LB[gc:a]C[B31: Black still puts pressure on White here in order to utilize the influence in the tengen and open up the situation. Black originally wants to play at 'a' on the upper side, but now if White plays at around 'a', then this area would be very broad, White can settle down; On the other hand, Black would be not easy to settle his shape from the top to the center.];W[ne]LB[gc:a][hc:b]C[W32: White has reinforced himself. Before and after this move, both sides want to grab the last biggest point at 'a' or 'b', which is worth noticing.];B[me];W[mf];B[nf];W[ng]LB[hc:a][oe:b][le:c][mg:d][gc:e]C[W34 and W36 are common shape. As for W34, if White instead extends at 35, though Black is thick locally, but the area at around 'a' would be taken by Black. Moreover, about W36, if White connects at 'b', then it would be obvious that Black will play the sequence of B 'c', W 'd' and B 'e', Black would still grab the good point at 'e'.];B[oe];W[of];B[ne]C[The sequence up to the connection of B39 is inevitable for both sides after the attachment of W32.];W[nj];B[om]LB[og:a][mg:b]C[B41 has the implication of the following tactic of the attachment of B45 and the cut of B47, this move is a light play at this time, at the same time it also has the implication of dealing with White's light capping move at 40 instead of strengthening at 'a' or 'b'.];W[mg]LB[hc:a]C[W42: White not only strengthens himself, but also restrict the possibility of Black's playing in the direction at 'a'.];B[ke];W[hc]C[W40 is an asking move, waiting for Black to play at 41, next White will connect at 42, then B43 and W44. If playing this way, White has nothing to regret about. W44 is now the absolutely biggest point on the board.];B[qm];W[rm];B[rn]LB[ql:a][pn:b]C[B45 and B47 is the counterattack tactic that we discussed earlier. As for B47, if Black simply extends at 'a', Black would help White settle down by playing at 'b', it would be insipid to play this way.];W[rl];B[ro]C[B49 can be regarded as the only move, W48 is also the strongest resistance, in other words, now it is the critical moment of deciding the outcome of the game.];W[pm];B[ql];W[qk];B[pl];W[pn];B[pk];W[qj];B[nl];W[pi]C[Through W58, the sequence is one-way street.];B[qp]C[After B59, Black invades the corner to make life, this is certainly Black's deserved compensation after White settles down with the sequence up to W58.];W[on]C[White has rescued his stones after W60, this is also the only play in this situation.];B[nn];W[no];B[mo];W[op]C[If W64 is omitted, Black would definitely play at 64.];B[qr];W[qq];B[rq];W[pr];B[rr]C[Through B69, the first battle comes to a temporary end, the result is even, both sides have nothing to complain.];W[mn]C[After W70, it leads to the second critical battle in the middle game.];B[nm];W[lm]LB[kp:a]C[W70 and W72: White aims at the squeezing play at 'a' and also serves as an asking move, these can be considered as tesujis.];B[ll]LB[mm:a][lk:b]C[B73: If Black plays the atari at 'a', then White will be left with a move at 'b', Black's big moyo, which was not easily obtained, would get reduced.];W[kp];B[mp];W[mq];B[ip];W[jq];B[kk]C[White has gained a lot of territory by capturing one black stone with W78 and White also has stabilized in this area. On the other hand, after Black strengthens at B79, Black has secured his territory in the center. The second battle of the middle game comes to an end.];W[cn]LB[ep:a][cj:b][dk:c]C[W80 is a severe conception, because next White has the tactic of the tiger's move or the attachment at 'b' and the cut at 'c'.];B[ep]C[B81: Black has no other alternative.];W[cj];B[ck];W[dk];B[cl]C[B85 is the strongest resistance at this time.];W[dl]C[W86 is tough and unyielding. The purpose of this move is to strengthen the outside by sacrificing the three stones W80, W84 and W86. Of course, these three stones can no longer be rescued.];B[ci];W[bj];B[bi];W[di];B[ej];W[bh];B[dm];W[ei]C[Black forces White to play W90 and W92 by sacrifice, and then settles himself with B91 and B93, Black also can only play like this.];B[fj]C[Then White gains advantage in sente with W94, Black can only connect with B95 in grief, this is a little painful for Black.];W[cm]C[With W96, White again takes advantage in sente.];B[ak]LB[bk:a][ai:b][el:c]C[B97 should be a known tesuji. If Black instead blocks at 'a', after W 'b' and B 'c', White can play the hane to bridge over at 97.];W[ai];B[el]C[Through B99, the third battle comes to an end. With regard to the whole game, it is very close.];W[bp];B[rf];W[co]C[If Black neglects W102, then White would continue playing here, it is still very big, because when Black links back W102, Black has the implication of invading with the sequence after 108.];B[qg]LB[og:a][rh:b]C[B103 is sente. Even though White answers at 'b', later on Black still can cut and capture at 'a'.];W[rh];B[jc]LB[fc:a]C[B105 is the only big point right now. By using B105, Black could invade at 'a'. This way Black will have a chance to attack White afterwards.];W[gq]C[The bridge-over of W106 is also the big point on the board now. White has obtained a territory of more than thirty points, however it is a gote move.];B[eq];W[en];B[fn];W[er];B[fr];W[dr];B[hq];W[hr];B[hp];W[gr];B[fc]C[After Black obtains sente with the sequence after B107, Black eventually decisively invades with B117, this leads to the fourth battle. This battle is not just a local combat, instead it will spread to the whole board.];W[ic];B[dc];W[cc];B[gd];W[he];B[ge];W[je];B[hd];W[id];B[hf];W[kd];B[le];W[kc]C[With the sequence from B125 through W130, both sides have invaded into each other's territory and formed an exchange, this exchange is even, so the outcome of the game is still not clear.];B[og]C[The cut and atari of B131 is a big move at this time.];W[oh];B[pg];W[em];B[ek];W[fm]C[W134 and W136 are pre-planned moves since W102.];B[gm];W[mb]C[The small knight's move of W138 is the biggest point on the board.];B[cb];W[ec];B[eb];W[dd];B[db]C[W140 and W142 are proper moves.];W[gb]C[The diagonal extension of W144 is very big.];B[bc];W[bd];B[bb]LB[fb:a]C[Because Black has seen that this would become an extremely close game, so he wants to take a tiny advantage with the hane and connect of B145 and B147. However this is not the right play. Black should patiently connect at 'a'. If so, the game would be closer, the outcome of the game would be decided in the endgame play. Black lacks a thorough consideration of these two moves, so he brings about unexpected weak points.];W[nb];B[oa];W[fb];B[ea];W[gh]C[W152 seems very common at a glance, in fact it is an excellent move. What kind of clever tactic it contains will be clear afterwards.];B[jf];W[ie];B[ff]C[B153 and B155 should be played in this order.];W[hi]LB[if:a]C[W156 is the vital point for attacking Black, making a miai of the push at 'a' and marching into the center, Black is guaranteed to get one of them.];B[hg]LB[fh:a]C[B157 is the strongest resistance at this time, Next Black can crosscut at 'a' to reduce liberties and attack White.];W[eo];B[fp];W[hl]C[After first exchanging W158 with B159, then White strikes at 160, which is indeed a God-granted clever move. (Rumors said that his student Maeda Nobuaki discovered this move.)];B[il]C[The attachment of B161 looks unusual, but I'm confident this move is the best defense at this time (Go Seigen).];W[jh]C[W162 is another painstaking move.];B[fh];W[fi];B[hj]LB[gi:a][hh:b]C[B163 and B165 are the strongest defense in the current time. If Black immediately cuts at 'a' with 165, after White connects at 'b', Black would collapse.];W[if]C[After W166, none of the following moves can be neglected.];B[ih];W[ii];B[ig];W[jg];B[ji];W[fg]C[W172 is an inevitable move.];B[kf];W[ij];B[ik];W[hh]LB[kh:a]C[W174 and W176 are sequence moves. After W174, White has the chance of turning at 'a' to rescue the two white stones.];B[gf];W[mk];B[df]LB[ml:a][kh:b]C[After W178, it leads to a miai of 'a' and 'b', White will definitely get one, but Black gets to play at 179.];W[ml];B[sm]C[B181 is a sequence play. After the sequence from W186 through W192, then the hane of B181 is no more effective, only with a hane at this time Black can take advantage in sente.];W[sk];B[mm];W[dg];B[li]C[B185 is an absolute move at this juncture.];W[ol];B[ln];W[nk];B[km];W[fl];B[gl];W[oj]C[Through W192, it can be said that all the extreme difficult problems since the play of W160 have been solved, although Black is painful, but the defense is nevertheless complete. As for the result, the five black stones are captured. Now although it is still a close game, however Black is not favorable, it is afraid that this is hard to change.];B[qh];W[ri]LB[qi:a][rg:b]C[W194: If White answers at 'a' instead, then Black could play at 'b' in sente, White is not gainful.];B[cf];W[ef];B[gi]C[B197 is a sequence play.];W[eh];B[ee];W[eg]LB[de:a]C[W200: For White to cut at 'a' to start a ko fight is unnecessary in this situation.];B[de];W[bf];B[bq];W[br];B[ps];W[os];B[qs];W[oq];B[bo];W[aq];B[an];W[bn];B[am];W[ao];B[rg]C[B215 is the biggest move on the board.];W[mi];B[qi];W[lh];B[kh];W[lj];B[rj];W[rk];B[sh];W[sj]C[After W224, White still needs one more move, which is worth attention.];B[bg];W[ae]C[W226 is a tesuji.];B[cg];W[ag];B[fe];W[gc];B[fd];W[ce];B[kg];W[mc]C[W234: If it were time for Black to play, Black also should play here.];B[ki];W[fk];B[ld];W[lc];B[gk];W[bk];B[bl];W[na];B[nc];W[gg];B[fa];W[ga];B[ac];W[ad];B[lg];W[mh];B[qo];W[lk]C[This match was played in the initial phase of the "New Fuseki", at the time I (Go Seigen) had been changing my style. However I think, some maneuvers that White had adopted to counter this new opening style are not necessarily the best. Since the middle game, totally five battles have been fought, the outcome of the game was not clear until B139. From W140, B135 lacks consideration, and then came the clever move of W160, thus White had established his winning position. Overall, with regard to me, this match is also very memorable.])
